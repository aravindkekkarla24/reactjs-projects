# React Counter App

A simple counter application built using **React Class Component**.
This project is beginner-friendly and helps understand basic React concepts.

## Features

* Increase the counter value
* Decrease the counter value
* Reset the counter to zero

## Concepts Used

* React Class Component
* State (`this.state`)
* `setState`
* Event Handling (`onClick`)
  

## File Structure

```
src/
 ├── App.css
 ├── App.js

```

## How It Works

* The counter value is stored in component state
* Buttons trigger methods to update the state
* UI updates automatically when state changes



## Learning Purpose
This project was created as part of my learning and practice of React class components and their methods, such as state, render, and event handling.
